# MyCraft
This is a game just like MineCraft on UNITY.

The user will be able to create objects, destroy them, climb levels, and collect points.
Î¤he user can give the dimensions that the floor wants to have.
The user can move to the next level using either arrows or the buttons (W, A, S, D).
Pressing the space button the player can jump onto cubes or cylinders.
It is not allowed to jump into 2 cubes.
Initially the player starts with 100 scores, 4 lives and 0 stocks.
Whenever the level rises, the user gets 10 points 
If the level decreases while playing, the player loses points.
In the event that a player falls into a void, he loses a life, the score is at 100 and returns him to his original position. 
If the player has no lives then the game ends.
When the user presses the p key, then the cube he is looking at, must give him some stock.
More specifically, it changes the color of the cube and gives it 1 but deducting 5 points from the score.
The player can not break a cube in blue, while the blue cube gives him +1 in the roll of cylinders instead of the cubes. 
These are done as long as the player's scores > 0. 
If the score is 0 and the player continues to press the key p, then a lifetime of the player is subtracted.
By pressing the b button the player, if he has a cube stock, creates cube of random color on either another cube or on
another cylinder. At the same time it rises by 10 the score while decreases by one the cube stock.
Similar to the c key.
The player, by pressing q, destroys a cube.
